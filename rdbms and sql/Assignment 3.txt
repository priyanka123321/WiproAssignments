Write a SELECT query to retrieve all columns from a 'customers' table, and modify it to return only the customer name and email address for customers in a specific city.


SELECT * FROM customers;

you can modify it to return only the customer name and email address for customers in a specific city, let's say the city is 'New York':

SELECT customer_name, email_address 
FROM customers 
WHERE city = 'New York';

This modified query selects only the 'customer_name' and 'email_address' columns from the 'customers' table, and it adds a 
WHERE clause to filter the results based on the city, in this case, 'New York'.
