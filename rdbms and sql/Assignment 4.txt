 Craft a query using an INNER JOIN to combine 'orders' and 'customers' tables for customers in a specified region, 
and a LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders.

SELECT c.*, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.region = 'specified_region';
